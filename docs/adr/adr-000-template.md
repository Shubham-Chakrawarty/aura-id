### 1. Context

Describe the **problem** you are solving. Why are we talking about this now? What are the technical or business constraints? Use "Beginner-Friendly" plain English here to explain the necessity.

### 2. Decision

The "Meat" of the document. Use a bold, clear statement of what is being adopted.

> "We will use..."

Include a bulleted list of technical specifics (e.g., versions, library names, or patterns).

### 3. Rationale

**The "Why."** This is the most important section for a Senior Developer.

- Why did we pick X over Y?
- How does this follow our "Single User, Multi-Context" blueprint?
- Reference the specific project standards (DRY, SOLID, Security).

### 4. Consequences

Every decision has a "price." Be honest here.

- **Positive:** What do we gain? (e.g., "Improved type safety," "Faster verification")
- **Negative/Risks:** What are the trade-offs? (e.g., "More boilerplate," "Learning curve")
- **Mitigation:** How will we handle the negatives?

### 5. Notes / Artifacts

Links to GitHub Issues, PRs, external documentation (like OIDC specs), or diagrams.
